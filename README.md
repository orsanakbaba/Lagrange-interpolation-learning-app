# Lagrange-interpolation-learning-app
Lagrange interpolating polynomial learning app

The project and source code is created by Manus AI (www.manus.im).
And the ap is deployed by Manus AI, accessible at : https://shxcpocd.manus.space/ 


The web app includes all the requested features:
*Input form for at least 5 data points (x,y coordinates)
*Interactive visualization of the interpolated polynomial
*Ability to show/hide individual Lagrange basis polynomials on the plot
*Step-by-step calculation display showing the interpolation process
*Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices
The application allows you to:
*Enter your own data points or use sample data
*Visualize the interpolated polynomial and basis polynomials
*See the mathematical formula of the interpolation
*Understand the step-by-step calculation process
*Adjust visualization parameters like zoom level and resolution
