===============

In numerical analysis, the Lagrange interpolating polynomial is the unique polynomial of lowest degree that interpolates a given set of data.


Given a data set of coordinate pairs $(x_j, y_j)$ with $0 \leq j \leq k,$ the $x_j$ are called **nodes** and the $y_j$ are called **values**. The Lagrange polynomial $L(x)$ has degree $\le k$ and assumes each value at the corresponding node, $L(x_j) = y_j$.

Although named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange, who published it in 1795, the method was first discovered in 1779 by Edward Waring. It is also an easy consequence of a formula published in 1783 by Leonhard Euler. 

Uses of Lagrange polynomials include the Newton–Cotes method of numerical integration, Shamir's secret sharing scheme in cryptography, and Reed–Solomon error correction in coding theory.
For equispaced nodes, Lagrange interpolation is susceptible to Runge's phenomenon of large oscillation.

The web app includes all the requested features:
---------------
> - Input form for at least 5 data points (x,y coordinates).
> - Interactive visualization of the interpolated polynomial.
> - Ability to show/hide individual Lagrange basis polynomials on the plot.
> - Step-by-step calculation display showing the interpolation process.
> - Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices.

The application allows you to:
---------------
> - Enter your own data points or use sample data.
> - Visualize the interpolated polynomial and basis polynomials.
> - See the mathematical formula of the interpolation.
> - Understand the step-by-step calculation process.
> - Adjust visualization parameters like zoom level and resolution.
